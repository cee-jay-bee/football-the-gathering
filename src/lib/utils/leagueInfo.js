  <p>Founded in 2023, Football the Gathering began out of a desire for the commissioner to dip his toes into Dynasty Leagues and being a commish at the same time. By bringing together a bunch of friends from real life football and other fantasy leagues, this league was born.</p>
  <p>Some managers built immediate win-now teams, while others began the slow process of building a juggernaut dynasty team. A portion of the league prioritized youth and draft picks, the rest gravitated towards the steadfast value of veterans. And some just made a commitment to be middle of the pack every year.</p>
  <p>In astounding commitment to building a dynasty franchise and keeping Football the Gathering going forever, many of the managers have kids and are committed to building their love for the NFL and Dynasty football. The mini managers are being heavily indoctrinated into the fantasy lifestyle and will be expected to take an active role as soon as they can succesfully type out a coherent trade offer.</p>
  <p>After only one year, it's obvious there are very passionate managers, and then some who need reminders to set their lineup. Hopefully year 2 and the first ever rookie draft in the league will stoke the flame of all the managers in the league.</p>
  <p>While the ultimate prize is bragging rights and sending obnoxious texts to the rest of the league (looking at you, Ricky) for the next year, the champion manager also walks away with $280 and bragging rights for the next year.</p>
